# TGC
Tactical Gear Component mod for SPT

Tactical Gear Component (TGC) will become a big mod for new gear, attachments, and more. This is kind of a preview for the items that will be added for an even bigger mod that will be released in the future, Welcome to Tarkov (WTT). WTT will feature a lot more than only new items. 3 new containers are also included. MEDICAL POUCH, AMMO POUCH and TOOLBOX CASE.

---------------

How you install this mod:

- Download Painter
- Drag folder in ZIP into SPT folder
- Download Tactical Gear Component
- Drag folder in ZIP into SPT folder
- Done. Now you have to do Painters quests to unlock everything

If you use custom load order for other mods, you have to make sure Painter is loading before my other mods. If you're not using order.json then you can disregard this message.
